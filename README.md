# Spin-Computations
This repo contains calculations for spin computations(including XXZ Model) using libraries like numpy, scipy and quimb.The problem statements are present in spin computations.pdf. It also contains some of the reproduced results of "Kormos - 2017 - Real-time confinement following a quantum quench to a non-integrable model".
